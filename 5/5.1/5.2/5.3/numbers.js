// Numbers

/* 
    two types of
    1. Regular numbers
    2. BigInt numbers   
    
    They are sometimes needed because a regular integer number canâ€™t safely 
    exceed (2(53)-1) or be less than -(253-1), as we mentioned earlier in the chapter Data types.
     As bigints are used in few special areas, we devote them a special chapter BigInt.
