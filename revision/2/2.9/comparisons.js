// Boolean is a string

/*
Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.
Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.
Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
